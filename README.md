# cpp_project_open_source-
this is open source c++ project no one has the right to monopolize it away from others under any excuse
everyone who download this project in his device has the right to modify it and edit it but only if he knows c++ coding
if you don't know coding just execute the maain.cpp by clicking the run green triangle symbol without editing anything in in or in any secondary file rather than main.cpp and I mean do not edit any character, even space bar, it can give significant change in code meaning, leave it as it is
if you know coding in c++ then you can edit either the main.cpp or any secondary file you want wether in source folder or headers folders and you can even take it as a begining small project to start your own project in data analysis
if you make a mistake by editing a line of code in a file by accident and you don't know how to fix it just deleted all the messed up project and re download it from here in github
or keep a safety copy at another folder in your device as security measure
the purpose of this project is for civil engineering to calculate the stiffness matrix of a multi floors building
if you need anymore details I forgot to mention here contact me by the available options:
